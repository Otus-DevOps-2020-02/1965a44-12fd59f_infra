        type: list

- retrieve_image_info
        Populate the `image' host fact for the instances returned with the GCP image name
        By default this plugin does not attempt to resolve the boot image of an instance to the image name cataloged in GCP because of the
        performance overhead of the task.
        Unless this option is enabled, the `image' host variable will be `null'
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

        type: list

- service_account_contents
        A string representing the contents of a Service Account JSON file. This should not be passed in as a dictionary, but a string that
        has the exact contents of a service account json file (valid JSON).
        [Default: (null)]
        set_via:
          env:
          - name: GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CONTENTS

        type: string

        [Default: (null)]
        set_via:
          env:
          - name: GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE
          - name: GCE_CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH

        type: path

- strict
        If `yes' make invalid entries a fatal error, otherwise skip and continue.
        Since it is possible to use facts in the expressions they might not always be available and we ignore those errors by default.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- use_contrib_script_compatible_sanitization
        By default this plugin is using a general group name sanitization to create safe and usable group names for use in Ansible. This
        option allows you to override that, in efforts to allow migration from the old inventory script.
        For this to work you should also turn off the TRANSFORM_INVALID_GROUP_CHARS setting, otherwise the core engine will just use the
        standard sanitization on top.
        This is not the default as such names break certain functionality as not all characters are valid Python identifiers which group
        names end up being used as.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool
        version_added: 2.8

- vars_prefix
        prefix to apply to host variables, does not include facts nor params
        [Default: ]

- zones
        A list of regions in which to describe GCE instances. If none provided, it defaults to all zones available to a given project.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: list
